# Stress and Validation Summary

## Synthetic Order Flow Generation

- Implemented `PoissonOrderFlowGenerator` with configurable arrival rates, price bands, and burst logic to emulate quote stuffing and sequencing noise.
- Integrated `SequenceValidator` and `validate_sequence` helpers; stress harness now records sequencing reports for every run.
- Added unit coverage in `tests/python/test_synthetic.py` to lock monotonic timestamps, burst flags, and validation error handling.

_Benchmarks produced by `python.scripts.run_stress_suite` (base messages=5k, base rate=8 kHz). Sequencing validator reported zero anomalies across all runs._

## Risk-Control Validation Highlights

- **Order rate limit** (`max_actions=2 / 1µs`) halted the strategy after the third submission, logging a `control_violation` and propagating a `StrategyError` kill switch.
- **Cancel throttling** (`max_actions=1 / 1µs`, no halt) suppressed the second cancel request; the targeted order remained active, and the throttle event was captured in the metrics log.
- **Kill switch** (inventory limit 5 units) triggered after injecting a 10-unit fill, marking the strategy as halted and surfacing both warning and alert messages from the `RiskEngine`.
- Automated checks stored in `results/week4/stress/risk_controls/` with per-scenario JSONL logs and summary JSON (`risk_controls.json`).

## Log Integrity Review

- `python.scripts.check_logs` parses JSONL artefacts, feeding reconstructed events into `SequenceValidator`.
- `results/week4/stress/log_integrity.json` captures outcomes: order/cancel streams are clean; the kill-switch scenario correctly flags a single orphan execution (expected, because the fill is synthetic without a resting order).

## Artefact Index (week 4)

- `results/week4/stress/stress_suite.json` — throughput, latency, and sequence summaries for 1×/10×/100× benchmarks.
- `results/week4/stress/risk_controls/` — per-control JSONL logs plus consolidated `risk_controls.json`.
- `results/week4/stress/log_integrity.json` — automated log anomaly scan results.

## Suggested Next Steps

- Re-run the stress suite against the C++ order book bridge to compare latency envelopes.
- Extend log-integrity tooling to consume live trading data feeds once available.
- Parameterise rate/latency thresholds to gate CI regressions automatically.
