CPU Hot Spots (perf sample %):
- matching::match_into      47.3%  Cache misses spike at depth >8, optimize price-level iterator.
- feeds::decode_l2          18.9%  Consider SIMD decoding for batched packets.
- risk::snapshot            12.4%  Lock contention on inventory map; shard by symbol.

Memory / Leak Scan:
- No persistent leaks detected; peak RSS 512 MB, steady-state 410 MB.
- Fragmentation observed in arena allocator after 45 min soak; enable periodic compaction.

Lock / Thread Profiling:
- Matching engine spin-lock: 9.2% contention under 150k msg/s (plan: convert to MCS lock).
- Checkpoint writer mutex: 3.1 ms p99 hold time when failover triggered; schedule I/O to async thread pool.
